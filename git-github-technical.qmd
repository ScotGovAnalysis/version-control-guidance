## Aims

-   These slides aim to demonstrate the use of Git and GitHub in the Scottish Government when working in the SCOTS network.

-   An understanding of the concepts of version control, Git and GitHub is assumed. 
More information can be found in the [Introduction to Version Control slides](https://alicebyers5.github.io/presentations-and-blogs/2023-04-27_git-github-intro/slides.html).

-   Further guidance and resources for using version control on SCOTS are available on the [Statistics Group sharepoint site](https://scotsconnect.sharepoint.com/sites/StatisticsGroup-Org-SG/SitePages/Version-Control.aspx).

# Git setup {.h1-blue}

## Install Git

-   Make an [iFix request](https://ifix.systems.gov.scot/assystnet/application.jsp#serviceOfferings/257) for "Git version 2.21.0.windows.1"

-   Git is a free and open-source software and therefore does not incur a cost to install


## Git Bash

-   Git Bash is a command line interface for using Git

-   It is installed with Git

![](images/screenshots/git-bash.png){fig-align="center" width=60%}


## Git Bash

-   Some basic commands include:

    - `pwd`; prints present working directory
  
    - `ls`; lists files contained in working directory
  
    - `cd <filepath>`; changes working directory

-   [Git Bash cheat sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet)

-   ONS Learning Hub has further training on [Command Line Basics](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/command-line-basics/)


## Set name and email {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   Your name and email is linked to every commit you make using Git

-   If you plan to use GitHub, make sure your user name and email address match those associated with your GitHub account

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Screenshot

![](images/screenshots/git-config.png){fig-align="center" width=50%}

### Code

```bash
# Set user name
git config --global user.name <username>

# Set email
git config --global user.email <email>

# Check this has worked.
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

:::

## Summary

-   Install Git via iFix

-   Set name and email address in Git Bash


# Git workflow {.h1-blue}


## Example project folder

<br>

![](images/screenshots/file-explorer.png){fig-align="center" width=80%}

::: {.notes}
-   Avoid storing projects using Git in OneDrive
:::


## Open Git Bash in working directory {.h2-no-padding}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### File Explorer

-   Right click in project folder and select 'Git Bash here'

![](images/screenshots/git-bash-here.png){fig-align="center" width=60%}
 
### cd in Git Bash

-   Open Git Bash from Windows start menu

-   Use `cd` command to change directory to your working folder

![](images/screenshots/cd.png){fig-align="center" width=50%}

:::


## Initiate Git respository {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   Run `git init` to initiate Git. 
This will create a .git folder within your project. 
(Note: you only need to do this once per project.)

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Screenshot

![](images/screenshots/git-init.png){fig-align="center" width=60%}

### Code

```bash
git init
```

:::

## Create a gitignore file {.smaller}

-   The gitignore defines what files **should not be tracked** by Git

-   This is especially important if you plan on using GitHub as sensitive information should not be made available there

-   Generally, the following should be ignored:

    -   Data files

    -   Passwords or credentials

    -   Code that contains sensitive information

    -   Configuration files


## Create a gitignore file {.smaller}

To tell Git to ignore these files:

-   Create a new file in your directory called `.gitignore`. 
This can be done in the usual way in File Explorer, or by using the `touch` command in Git Bash.

-   Open the gitignore file in a text editor (or R) and add names of folders and files to be ignored.

    -   If you're not sure what to include, this [example gitignore](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/welcome/blob/main/.gitignore) contains many common data and R files. Copy the contents to the file you've just created.


## git status {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   Use `git status` to show a summary of your Git repository - run this often to check that your other git commands have done what you expect them to do

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Screenshot

![](images/screenshots/git-status.png){fig-align="center" width=50%}

-   Notice that `data.csv` is not listed here. This is because we have told Git to ignore csv files in the gitignore.

### Code

```bash
git status
```

:::

## git add {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   Use `git add` to 'stage' files for the next commit

    - Either list the files you'd like to stage; e.g. `git add code.R`, or
    
    - To stage all tracked files, use a full stop; e.g. `git add .` 

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Screenshot

![](images/screenshots/git-add.png){fig-align="center" width=60%}

### Code

```bash
git add .
```

:::

## git add {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   Use `git status` to check that the correct files have been staged

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Screenshot

![](images/screenshots/git-add-status.png){fig-align="center" width=60%}

-   Files names are now coloured green and listed under 'changes to be committed'

### Code

```bash
git status
```

:::


## git commit {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   Use `git commit` to commit the files to the Git history

    -   All staged files will be included in the commit

    -   Accompany the commit with a message to give a [short and informative description](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/version_control.html#write-short-and-informative-commits) of the changes
    
::: {.panel-tabset}

### Screenshot 

![](images/screenshots/git-commit.png){fig-align="center" width=55%}

### Code

```bash
git commit -m "Add files"
```

:::


## Your first commit {.h2-no-padding}

-   Running `git status` again shows that there are no further changes to commit

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Screenshot

![](images/screenshots/git-commit-status.png){fig-align="center" width=70%}

### Code

```bash
git status
```

:::


## Your first commit {.h2-no-padding}

-   Running `git log --oneline` will give a short summary of the commit history

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Screenshot

![](images/screenshots/git-log.png){fig-align="center" width=70%}

### Code

```bash
git log --oneline
```

:::


## Make a change

-   Now, let's make a change to `code.R`. 
Add some commented lines to give the script a title and description.

![Before](images/screenshots/code-orig.png){width=48%}

::: {.fragment}
![After](images/screenshots/code-change.png){width=48%}
:::

:::
</center>


## Make a change

-   Run `git status` to check that Git has recognised the change

![](images/screenshots/unstaged-change.png){fig-align="center" width=70%}


## git diff {.h2-no-padding}

- Run `git diff` to inspect what changes have been made to `code.R`.
Green text highlights additions and red text highlights deletions.

![](images/screenshots/git-diff.png){fig-align="center" width=70%}


## Stage and commit the change {.h2-no-padding}

-   Use `git add` and `git commit` to stage and commit the change to `code.R`.

![](images/screenshots/stage-and-commit-change.png){fig-align="center" width=70%}


## Stage and commit the change

-   Use `git log` to view the Git history - there are now two commits

![](images/screenshots/git-log-2.png){fig-align="center" width=70%}


## Tips

-   Commit often (especially when you're still learning)

-   Write [commit messages that make sense](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/version_control.html#write-short-and-informative-commits) (your future self and colleagues will thank you)

-   Run `git status` often (especially when you're still learning)

    -   Check which files have changes tracked
    
    -   Check you have staged the correct files

    -   Check files that should be ignored are not being tracked (and committed!)


## Summary

-   Make a change

-   `git add`

-   `git commit`

-   `git status` often


# Using Git with RStudio Integration {.h1-blue}

## RStudio {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   You can also interact with Git from within RStudio (instead of using Git Bash)

-   Not all Git functionality is available, but it can be more user-friendly and convenient if you're working with R

-   Changes are listed in the Git pane (usually in the top right window)

![](images/screenshots/rstudio-git.png){fig-align="center" width=55%}


## Open the commit window

-   Click the 'Commit' button to open up the commit window

![](images/screenshots/rstudio-git-2.png){fig-align="center" width=75%}


## Commiting a change from RStudio {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   Like Git Bash, you need to both stage and commit the change

-   To stage, tick the box next to each file you'd like to add (top-left pane)

-   To commit, enter a message and click 'Commit' (top-right pane)

![](images/screenshots/rstudio-commit.png){fig-align="center" width=55%}




# Setting up a project in RStudio

## Initial setup - Github 

In Github (skip these 4 steps if copying an existing project from Github):

1.	Click Repositories > New.
2.	Enter a name and choose public/private (you almost certainly want private to start with; you can still grant collaborators access by inviting them to the project).


## Initial setup - Github 

3.	Check the Add README box, choose the R .gitignore template and GPL-3.0 license.
4.	Click Create Repository. You should be taken to the repository’s home page, with a list of files contained in it (at the moment only the readme and gitignore files).




## Initial setup - Git Bash

Once a repository has been created in Github, you can clone it and start working on it in RStudio.

In Git Bash:

1.   Navigate to the folder you want to place the local version of your repository in by running the command: 

`cd /c/Users/<folder location>`

(e.g., `cd /c/Users/u449906/Documents/R/repos/`) 

## Initial project setup - Git Bash
2. Clone the repository from github to your repos folder using the command: 

`git clone git@github.com:[github location].git`

(e.g.: `git clone git@github.com:DavidFrenchSG/TestProject.git`) 

Note that the folder can’t have existed already – if it does, then rename it, then copy the files into the folder that is created by the Git Bash steps. 

## Initial project setup - Git Bash
3. If you already have scripts or other files you want to add to the project, copy and paste them into the folder that was just created (e.g., C:/Users/u449906/Documents/R/repos/TestProject/). 


## Initial project setup - RStudio

In RStudio:

1. File > New Project > Existing Directory 
2. Click Browse, navigate to the folder that was created above (in this example C:/Users/u449906/Documents/R/repos/TestProject) 
3. Click “Create Project” 


## Initial project setup - RStudio
4. You should see a list of files in the bottom right quadrant, including the README and gitignore files you created in Github, any files you copied and pasted into the folder manually, and an .Rproj file. 
6. You should also see a “Git” tab in the top right quadrant (next to Environment, History and Connections). Click this, then check all the boxes under “Staged”, then click “Commit”.

## Initial project setup - RStudio   
7. Enter a commit message (e.g., “Initial commit”), and then click “Commit”.
8. Click “Push”, then “Close”. A successful push will result in a message something like this: 

`>>> C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe push origin HEAD:refs/heads/master`

`To github.com:DavidFrenchSG/TestProject.git `
      `20b6e7f..f500f76  HEAD -> master `


## Initial project setup - RStudio
You should now be able to Pull, edit and Push code between the remote repository (i.e., Github) and your local repository (i.e, your C Drive). 

Remember to modify your gitignore file to ensure that data files aren’t stored on github. [This one](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/road_casualty_map/blob/main/.gitignore) is a good example to follow. 

## Collaborative coding – basic setup 1

A simple collaborative coding setup can be achieved by the project owner adding collaborators in Github:

1.   On the repository page click “Settings” (near the top). 
2.   Choose “Collaborators” in the pane on the left. 
3.   Click the green “Add people” button and then add collaborators by entering their Github usernames or email addresses. 



## Collaborative coding – basic setup 2
-   Collaborators can clone, pull, edit, commit and push etc. 

-   If people are working on a file simultaneously, their changes will be automatically merged when they push. If there are conflicts in their code, they will be asked to review and fix the conflicts. 

-   A more complicated (but better!) process, including the use of branches and pull requests, is discussed in Step 3 of [this guide](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67).

# Using Git with GitHub {.h1-blue}

## Remote repository

-   A 'remote' is a version of your Git repository hosted on the internet or network somewhere

-   This should be thought of as the main place where your repository is stored

-   Most commonly, GitHub is used to host remote repositories.
But, it could also be a folder on an internal shared network.


## Remote repository {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   Users take a copy ('clone') of the repository from the remote

-   Users regularly 'push' their changes back to the remote so other users have access to the latest version

-   Users regularly 'pull' from the remote to ensure they are working with the latest version

![](images/screenshots/remote.png){fig-align="center" width=40%}


## SSH keys

-   An SSH key is a way of identifying yourself to GitHub that means you don't have to provide your username and password every time

-   You must use an SSH key when working with GitHub on SCOTS

-   To set up, generate an SSH key pair in Git Bash and add the public key to your GitHub account

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
You only need to create an SSH key once per device.
:::


## Create SSH key

-   Generate an SSH key in Git Bash

    ```{r engine = "bash"}
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

    (Use the email registered with your Github account)

-   When asked where you want to create the key, press enter to use the default location

-   When asked if you want to set a passphrase, press enter twice to skip


## Add SSH key to GitHub account

-   Copy the SSH key:

    ```{r engine = "bash"}
    # Navigate to the directory where you've saved your SSH key
    cd ~/.ssh

    # Print the contents of the public SSH key file
    cat id_ed25519.pub
    ```
    
    Copy the returned value from Git Bash.

-   [Add the copied SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account) by going to Settings, then SSH and GPG keys

## Check that SSH key has been added properly

-   Test that the SSH connection has been properly set up by running this command in Git Bash: 

    ```{r engine = "bash"}
    # Test if ssh key works (say yes if asked whether you want to continue)
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```
        
-   If you get this message, it has worked: 
    ```{r engine="bash"}
    Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
    ```

## Clone repository from GitHub {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   Now you have an SSH key set up, you should use the SSH URL to clone repositories from GitHub

-   Click the green 'Code' button and under 'Clone', select 'SSH', and copy the address

![](images/screenshots/copy-ssh.png){fig-align="center" width=50%}


## Clone repository from GitHub {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   Open Git Bash and [navigate to the directory](#open-git-bash-in-working-directory) you'd like to clone the repository to

-   Use `git clone <url>` to clone the repository

-   Change directory to the cloned repository using `cd`

![](images/screenshots/git-clone.png){fig-align="center" width=55%}


## Make a change {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   Follow [Git workflow](#git-workflow) to:

    -   Add a new file

    -   `git add`

    -   `git commit`

![](images/screenshots/github-repo-change.png){fig-align="center" width=50%}


## Push to GitHub {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   'Push' the commit to GitHub (the remote) using `git push`

-   Note that `git status` now says the repository is up to date with origin/main (this is another name for the remote repository)

![](images/screenshots/git-push.png){fig-align="center" width=55%}


## Push to GitHub {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   The new file and commit is now visible by viewing the GitHub repository

![](images/screenshots/git-push-2.png){fig-align="center" width=65%}


## Pull from GitHub {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   'Pull' from GitHub regularly using `git pull` to ensure your local copy of the repository is up to date (especially if other people are also working on the repository)

-   Note that there is now an extra commit when running `git log`

![](images/screenshots/git-pull.png){fig-align="center" width=55%}


## Summary

-   Use SSH keys to connect to GitHub from Git Bash

-   `git clone` to clone a repository from GitHub

-   Follow [Git workflow](#git-workflow) described earlier in slides

-   `git push` often to push local commits to GitHub

-   `git pull` often to pull new commits on GitHub to local copy/clone


# There's more! {.h1-blue}

::: {.notes}
-   The content covered so far will hopefully be enough to help you get started using Git and GitHub.
-   However, there are more features that are of particular use when working and collaborating with others.
:::


## Branches {.h2-no-padding .smaller}

-   When you create a Git repository, you begin with a single 'branch', usually called `main`

-   The `main` branch is usually viewed as the 'production-ready' version of your code

-   You can create new branches to make developments, test new ideas and to facilitate multiple people working on the code at the same time

-   Branches allow users to make changes to files without affecting the 'production-ready' `main` branch

-   Changes made in a branch can be peer reviewed before being merged into the `main` branch

-   More information on branching in the [Duck book](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/version_control.html#use-branching-appropriately)


## GitHub features {.smaller}

-   [Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests) and [code review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests)

    -   Open a pull request to merge a branch and request a code review from a collaborator

-   [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues)

    -   Keep track of bugs and requested enhancements for future development

-   [Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects)

    -   A task board for planning and tracking work. Integrates with issues and pull requests.
